         <P>

            It lets you store cash securely with an insured bank or credit union and earn returns on the balance.
            GROUPFND Bank offers a wide range of savings accounts. Choose as per your
            requirements and opt for online account opening rather than going to a branch.

            where every transaction helps you earn points.

        <b style="color:blue;">CURRENT ACCOUNT:</b>
       <P>
           A current account is a type of deposit account that caters to
           professionals and businessmen alike. Dealing largely with liquid deposits, 
           this product allows for withdrawal of funds and checks being written against 
           the balance and does not limit the number of transactions in a day. At GROUPFUND Bank,
           we offer a number of customised current account options that can ideally serve the needs of different operations.
       </P>
       <b style="color:blue;">FIXED DEPOSITS:</b>
       <p>
           A fixed deposit (FD) is a financial instrument provided 
           by banks which provides investors 
           with a higher rate of interest than a regular savings
           account, until the given maturity date.
